5/9/16 - Update:
Wrote code to handle pushing the new base item to the database and creating an new transaction and 
inventory item for that base item if an initial quanitity is entered. Was able to verify that the 
push of the base item worked but will need to continue on with the creation and push of the transaction and
inventory item. Also created a function to handle blank entries for the fields not required to submit.

5/6/16 - Update:
All frmNewBaseItem combo boxes will fill with the appropriate content. Also put together plan

inventory items. The inventory items will use the base item as template but allow for 
changes to the facility, location, bin, program, condition, value.

Made adjustments to table structure, fixed required field validation for frmNewBaseItem
